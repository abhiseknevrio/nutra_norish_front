But how much it helps I suddenly realised after consuming nutranourishes probiotics !!! Instead of taking Zyrtec or other antihistaminics, it was simply enough to consume one of these supplements on late food nights!! It prevents for me the next day sneezing and further agony!! It helped my gut health so efficiently that my stomach size reduced in the mornings to a normal size!! And it significantly reduced gastric related symptoms!!! It s incredible as I didnâ€™t find this much potency in any other store bought grades!! It definitely works! And I consume it everyday now after the initial phase, stomach, digestion, sleep all quite improved.That was one great prescription Dr Menka!! Good job both you and the little therbiotic caps",
